Exercises and Examples from Chris Pine's Learn To Program


Whilst I was working towards an application for Makers Academy bootcamp, I was recommended Chris Pine's Learn To Program for the basics of Ruby. After successfully securing a place on the bootcamp I have decided to return to Chris Pine to write up some examples and exercises set throughout the book. My taask here is to practice using Github whilst practicing the Ruby basics prior to my cohort commencing with Makers Academy.
